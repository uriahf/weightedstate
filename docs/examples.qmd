### Single-event setting

This example demonstrates how to use `weighted_aalen_johansen` to perform a weighted survival estimation. The results coincide with a weighted Kaplan–Meier estimator.

```python
import polars as pl
from weightedstate.survival import weighted_aalen_johansen

times = pl.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
reals = pl.Series([1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
weights = pl.Series([0.5, 1.5, 0.8, 1.2, 0.9])

result = weighted_aalen_johansen(times, reals, weights)
print(result)
```

### Competing risks setting

This example shows how to use the function for a weighted cumulative incidence estimation in a competing risks setting.

```python
import polars as pl
from weightedstate.survival import weighted_aalen_johansen

times = pl.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
reals = pl.Series([1, 0, 1, 2, 0])
weights = pl.Series([0.5, 1.5, 0.8, 1.2, 0.9])

result = weighted_aalen_johansen(times, reals, weights)
print(result)
```
