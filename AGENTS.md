## `quartodoc`

This project uses `quartodoc` to generate the API reference documentation. To build the documentation, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
quarto render docs
```

The output will be in the `docs/_site` directory. You can open the `index.html` file in that directory to view the documentation.
