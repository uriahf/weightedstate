    "text": "The terminology and methods used in weightedstate are consistent with established literature on survival and multistate analysis.\nThe weighted Kaplan–Meier estimator has been described in various contexts, including inverse-probability weighting for causal inference. Keogh & Van Geloven (2024) discuss the use of weighted Kaplan–Meier after artificial censoring, which is a specific application of the general weighted estimator implemented here. In the single-event setting, the weighted Aalen–Johansen estimator in weightedstate is equivalent to this weighted Kaplan–Meier estimator.\nStandard survival analysis texts establish the Aalen–Johansen estimator as the multistate generalization of the Kaplan–Meier estimator. The introduction of weights, as implemented in weightedstate, follows the principles of weighted Nelson–Aalen and product-limit estimators, where weights are incorporated into the risk sets and event counts.",

    "text": "The Aalen–Johansen estimator is a non-parametric method for estimating transition probabilities in a multistate model. It can be expressed as a product-integral of the cumulative hazard increments, which are estimated using a non-parametric equivalent of a Nelson–Aalen estimator.\nThe introduction of weights into this framework is straightforward. The weighted Aalen–Johansen estimator is calculated in the same way as the unweighted version, but with the risk sets and event counts adjusted by the provided weights. Specifically, at each event time, the number of individuals at risk and the number of events are replaced by the sum of their corresponding weights.\n\nKaplan–Meier as a special case\nThe Kaplan–Meier estimator, used for estimating the survival function in single-event survival analysis, is a special case of the Aalen–Johansen estimator. This equivalence holds when the multistate model has only two states: an initial state and an absorbing event state.\nWhen weights are introduced, this relationship is preserved. A weighted Kaplan–Meier estimator is the two-state special case of the weighted Aalen–Johansen estimator.",
